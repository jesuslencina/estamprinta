# ESTAMPRINTAS

**Deploy**: https://estamprinta.netlify.app/

*Estamprintas* is a fictionary e-commerce site, in which re-printed stamps from different locations are sold. 

Made by Jesus Lencina for Coderhouse.

### FEATURES

- Browse the full catalog available stamps
- Filter by five different **categories**
- Click any of them to enter its **detailed view**, and select an amount to **add it to your cart**
- View the items in your **cart**, check how many stamps you're buying, and how much will it be. You can also **remove items** 
- Closed your browser? No problem! the **cart** stays in **localstorage** till you remove every item or purchase. 


### TOOLS USED TO BUILD IT 

- **ReactJS**
- **Create React App**
- **Styled Components** - Extremely useful for a clearer and more organised CSS setup
- **Spectre CSS** - An amazing CSS framework to work with so as not to make all styles from scratch
- **React Router DOM** - Handy for handling the display of each section, and managing the navigation's route
- **Firebase's Firestore** - This is where the stamps' data is stored, and where the app accesses it

#### Extra pro-coder challenges implemented:
- Persistent Cart in localstorage
